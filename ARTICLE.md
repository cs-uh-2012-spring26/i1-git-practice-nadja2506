**What I found interesting about this article:**As a student studying 
computer science, I found this article very interesting because it helped
me understand the real-world impact of software engineers and 
responsibility software engineers hold. More specifically, article 
explains how software does not impact users only technically, but also    
influences society, safety and even public trust. By stating 8 basic 
guidelines, this article suggest how to be a responsible software engineer
who makes fair decisions and takes into consideration public good. This   
reminded me that to be a great software engineer one would need not to be
only a great coder, but also to act ethically so that the entire society  
benefits from technology available.
